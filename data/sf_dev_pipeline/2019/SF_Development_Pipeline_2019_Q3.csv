The project site is occupied by a 27-foot-tall, two-story over basement, industrial building that is approximately 13,710 gross square feet in size with 12 below-grade parking spaces. The existing automobile repair garage building was constructed in circa 1914 and is currently vacant (formerly occupied by ?Green Street Auto Body?). 

The project sponsor proposes a two-story vertical addition and a change of use to convert the existing automotive garage to a new residential development with five residential units. The project would add approximately 13,408 gross square feet to the existing building. The project includes 1,369 square feet of common open space in the form of a roof deck, and 2,265 square feet of private open space via balconies and terraces. The project includes alterations to the front facade, including the restoration of two pilasters that were removed from the central arch to allow for a wider garage opening during a 1933 alteration. With the proposed improvements, the building would be 40 feet tall (53 feet tall with elevator penthouse) and 27,118 gross square feet in size with 10 below-grade parking spaces and five class 1 bicycle parking spaces. In addition, the project includes the expansion of the existing basement by 1,615 square feet (from 5,516 square feet to 7,131 square feet). Project construction would require up to approximately 15 feet of excavation below ground surface, resulting in approximately 1,400 cubic yards of soil disturbance. Conventional hand-excavated end-bearing piers would be used for the proposed underpinning system. Heavy equipment would not be used within 10 horizontal feet from adjacent shallow foundations and basement walls; jumping jack or hand-operated vibratory plate compactors would be used for compacting fill within this zone. The project site is listed as an active leaking underground storage tank cleanup site on the Hazardous Waste and Substances Sites List (also known as the ?Cortese List?).","PROPOSAL IS TO MAINTAIN (E) GARAGE WALLS & CONSTRUCT (5) (N) RESIGENTIAL UNITS WITHIN (E) STRUCTURE & IN A TWO-STORY VERTICAL ADDITION.

The site is also located within the Kearny-Market-Mason-Sutter Conservation District. The existing seven-story, 242,730-square-foot (sf) building, constructed in 1974, consists of approximately 163,000 sf of retail use and 54,000 sf of accessory office use. The proposed project would convert the existing single-tenant building into a multi-tenant building consisting of retail, restaurant, and office uses. Floors 1-3 and the basement level would continue as retail use, but would be reconfigured to provide multiple tenant spaces with storefronts and public access along Stockton and O'Farrell Streets. Existing retail use would also be reconfigured on floors 4-6 to provide for multiple tenants. The project would include a change of use of 49,999 sf of retail use into office use on floors 6-7. A new roof top addition of approximately 10,800 sf is proposed for restaurant use. It would increase the building's total height from about 104 feet to 120 feet. The gross square footage for the proposed reconfigured building would be approximately 246,800 sf.

Proposed streetscape improvements include three new street lights, one existing relocated streetlight, and about 10 new street trees. All improvements would be coordinated with the SFMTA's Central Subway project plans. There is no existing or proposed off-street vehicle parking, but the project would request the SFMTA to install 28 class 2 on-street bicycle parking spaces in dual bike racks on Stockton and O'Farrell Streets, and would also install 30 class 1 bicycle spaces in the basement level. The existing uses are served by a loading dock containing three loading bays accessed from the narrow Security Pacific Place. This loading dock would be reconfigured for two loading bays and one service bay.

The project would require excavation of approximately 4,300 cubic yards of soil for structural upgrades to the building that would include perimeter tie beams, shear wall, and a sewage ejector and grease interceptor. The depth of excavation would extend to 12 feet below the existing basement. No particularly noisy equipment or impact equipment/devices would be required for construction of the proposed improvements. Construction activities would include demolition, site preparation, grading, interior and exterior upgrades to be completed in overlapping phases commencing in March 2019 and anticipated to be completed in May 2021.",,206840,-10141,,,0,,,0,,49999,-3890,,,0,,156841,-6251,,0,,,0,,,,ETUFFY,"Reuben, Junius & Rose, LLP",Tuija Catalano,4155679000,4 - Downtown,3,Financial District,Financial District/South Beach,Downtown Streetscape Plan; Downtown,C-3-R,80-130-F,Downtown/Van Ness/Northeast Neighborhoods PDA,,37.78697967,-122.4059534,2019,Q3,2019_Q3,POINT (-122.4059534 37.78697967),19,19,6,3,8

Thirty-two Class 1 bicycle parking spaces would be provided in a ground floor bicycle room, accessible via Newhall Street or through the residential lobby fronting Third Street. Ten Class 2 bicycle parking spaces would be provided adjacent to the project site on the surrounding sidewalks.

The proposed project would include excavation of approximately 300 cubic yards of material to a maximum depth of 8 feet below grade. The proposed foundation for the  building would be  drilled piers extending at least 10 feet below-grade and into bedrock. The proposed project would retain all of the existing street trees on the project site and would provide an additional seven street trees on Newhall Street, five street trees on Hudson Avenue, and two street trees on Third Street. A bulbout and parklet are proposed on the southeastern portion of the block, to increase the sidewalk width along Newhall Street.",,0,0,0,,,0,,,0,,,0,,,0,,,,0,0,,,,,,,,,,10 - South Bayshore,10,Bayview,Bayview Hunters Point,Bayview Hunters Point,M-1,40-X,Bayview/Southeast Neighborhoods PDA,Third Street; 3rd St Alcohol Restrict; Fringe Financial Services RUD,37.73989446,-122.3886489,2019,Q3,2019_Q3,POINT (-122.3886489 37.73989446),86,86,2,9,1

The lot is L-shaped, with approximately 92 feet of frontage along North Point Street and approximately 46 feet of frontage along Larkin Street. There are three lots at the corner of Larkin Street and North Point Street that separate the two frontages. The site is moderately upsloping along Larkin Street, moving south from North Point Street to Bay Street. The project site is within a NC-1, Neighborhood Commercial Cluster District and a 40-X Height and Bulk District.

An approximately 29,400-square foot parking garage, constructed in 1925, currently occupies the project site. The garage frontage is two-stories tall on North Point Street. Along Larkin Street, the lower floor of the garage is semi-subterranean, such that the frontage is one story tall. Access to the garage is provided via a curb cut and vehicular entrance on North Point Street, with an exit via curb cut on Larkin Street. A third curb cut on North Point Street is presently disused. The garage provides 65 spaces of pre-reserved monthly paid parking. 

The project would demolish the existing garage and construct two four-story, 40-foot-tall buildings (with maximum height of 46 feet for roof extensions and appurtenances). The two proposed buildings would be connected at the parking level, which would serve as the base for both buildings. Due to the grade change of the project site, this would be the ground level for the proposed building along North Point Street and a subterranean basement level for the proposed building along Larkin Street. In combination, the two proposed buildings would provide approximately 45,300 gsf of development, including approximately 12,700 square feet (sf) for a semi-subterranean parking garage, approximately 26,000 sf to accommodate 37 dwelling units, and approximately 1,300 sf of ground floor retail space.  The residential unit mix would consist of 13 studios, 13 one-bedrooms, 7 two-bedrooms, and 4 three-bedrooms units. The garage would provide 28 vehicle parking spaces, 57 class 1 bicycle parking spaces, and garbage and recycling collection areas, with vehicle entrance via a new 10-foot-wide curb cut near the western edge of the North Point Street frontage. The project also would provide eight class 2 bicycle parking spaces along North Point Street.  The building along North Point Street would contain a ground floor commercial space and a residential lobby entry for the residential units within the North Point building. A separate residential entry would also be provided for the building along Larkin Street including two units that have direct walk-up access. Each building would have an elevator and stairwell, and direct pedestrian and bicycle access to the shared garage. The project proposes a total of 2,000 sf of common open space including approximately 1,500 sf of common open space on the second level (atop the semi-subterranean garage) that would be shared between the two buildings and would be accessible from both, and an approximately 500 sf common open space deck on the fourth level of the proposed Larkin Street building. Decks, patios, and stoops within various levels of the two buildings would provide a total of about 2,700 sf of private open spaces. Consistent with the Better Roofs Ordinance, solar thermal panels would be provided on the North Point Street building roof.

Construction would require approximately 650 cubic yards of soil excavation. The depth of excavation is proposed at a maximum of 3 to 8 feet below ground surface within a 5,700 sf area. Construction activities would occur over 16 months commencing in March 2020 and are anticipated to be completed in June 2021.",,1282,1282,,,0,,,0,,,0,,,0,,1282,1282,,0,,,0,,,,VBYRD,TEF Design,Andrew Wolfram,415-901-4912,3 - Northeast,2,Russian Hill,Russian Hill,Fisherman’s Wharf Public Realm Plan; Northeast Waterfront,NC-1,40-X,Downtown/Van Ness/Northeast Neighborhoods PDA,,37.80514703,-122.422351,2019,Q3,2019_Q3,POINT (-122.422351 37.80514703),98,98,6,6,32

The project block is bounded by California Street to the north, Parker Avenue to the west, Euclid Avenue to the south, and Spruce Street to the east. The project site is currently occupied by an approximately 20-foot-tall, two-story, approximately 3,270-square-foot medical office building at the rear of the lot, constructed in 1950, with a surface parking lot with eight off-street vehicle spaces accessible from California Street.

The proposed project would demolish the existing medical office building and parking lot and construct a 15,060-square-foot, four-story, 40-foot-tall mixed-use residential building with nine dwelling units. The project?s ground floor level would include 530 square feet of commercial space and 1,400 square feet of garage space?with seven vehicle parking spaces and nine Class 1 bicycle racks. Floors 2 through 4 would contain nine residential units. The unit mix would be five three-bedroom units, one two-bedroom unit, and one one-bedroom unit.  Private open space would be provided for each dwelling unit on floor 2 and the remaining open space would be provided on the roof.

During the anticipated 18-month construction period, there would be approximately 300 cubic yards of excavation across the site to a depth of approximately 5 feet. The geotechnical investigation recommends that the foundation consist of conventional spread footing.","ERECT A 4 STORY, TYPE 3, MIXED USE BLDG W/ 7 RESIDENTIAL UNITS.",872,-2398,,,0,,,0,3270,0,-3270,,,0,0,872,872,,0,,,0,,,,VBYRD,"Reuben, Junius & Rose, LLP",Daniel Frattin,415-567-9000,1 - Richmond,2,Presidio Heights,Presidio Heights,,NC-S,40-X,,,37.78601824,-122.4541774,2019,Q3,2019_Q3,POINT (-122.4541774 37.78601824),11,11,8,6,31

The existing two-story, two-unit residential building at 1060-1062 Oak Street constructed in 1900 is a historic resource, and would be relocated 49 feet east of its present location on Oak Street as part of the project. The project would construct a 3- to- 6-story, 40-foot to 65-foot-tall (81 feet at the top of the elevator penthouse), mixed-use building, with 184 residential units above 8,100 gross square feet (gsf) of ground floor retail with frontages on Divisadero and Oak Streets ? see project plans dated April 23, 2019. 

The proposed 150,000 gross square foot building would include 89 studios, 21 one-bedroom, and 74 two-bedroom units.

A total of 15,268 square feet of common open space would be provided in a rear yard, a second floor courtyard, and a roof deck, and 2,403 square feet of private open space in a combination of patios and balconies.  A residential lobby would be located on the ground-floor with access from Oak Street. A ground-floor bicycle storage room would provide 170 Class I bicycle parking spaces. A ground-floor parking garage would provide 56 parking spaces, one car-share space, and a single commercial loading space, with access via a proposed 18-foot curb cut on Oak Street, 150 feet east of the intersection of Oak and Divisadero streets. Seven existing curb cuts would be removed. Fourteen Class II bicycle parking spaces and 14 street trees would be installed in the public right-of-way on the two project frontages.

The project site slopes up from south to north. In addition, the project site slopes up from east to west. The site is currently occupied by a two-story-over-basement, 50-foot tall building containing an automobile dealership and showroom. The proposed project would renovate the interior of the building and convert the existing automobile dealership and showroom to a health club containing exercise equipment, group fitness rooms and locker room spaces, a lounge, restaurant, and indoor pool on the second floor. In addition, the project proposes to convert a portion of the roof above the proposed swimming pool into a retractable roof. There would be no physical expansion of the existing building envelope. The health club would occupy approximately 39,940 square feet in the basement, ground, and second floors. 

Approximately 1,500 square feet of the basement level would be retained as a loading dock; the remainder of the basement would be converted to health club use. The project would reduce the total number of vehicular parking spaces on-site from 19 to 0, allowing only for bicycle parking and storage. The proposed project would comply with bicycle parking requirements. 

The project would excavate no more than 49 cubic yards of soil to a maximum depth of 2?0? below ground for foundation work. Construction activities primarily consist of interior work for new partitions, a new pool and jacuzzi area, restroom and locker areas, restaurant fit-out, and interior finishes.

The project site is a through lot, with frontages on Jerrold Avenue and Bayshore Boulevard. The block is bounded by Jerrold Avenue to the northeast, Barneveld Avenue to the east, Oakdale Avenue to the south, and Bayshore Boulevard to the west. The existing project site includes approximately 9,000 square-foot warehouse building and an approximately 5,000 square foot office building. The project would be completed by San Francisco Public Works department and will implement Standard Construction Measures for Public Works projects.

The proposed project consists of a temporary Navigation Center, providing temporary (approximately 4 years) housing and social services to the homeless (approximately 128 beds). The project involves interior tenant improvements within the existing warehouse building to create an insulated, conditioned dormitory space and associated improvements to provide natural light and access to the building. Modular buildings would be added to the properties and placed both outside, and connected to the exterior of the existing warehouse building. These modular buildings would provide showers, restrooms, and other accessory uses. Landscaping improvements along with the construction of a deck would also occur to create use-able outdoor space. The existing approximately 5,000 square-foot office space would remain as is with interior tenant improvements, and be used by the Navigation Center. 
The project would not include any expansion of the existing buildings (other than the temporary modular buildings connected to the existing warehouse building) and no permanent structures would be constructed as part of this project. 
A notification of the project receiving Environmental Review went out on 3/9/2018. There were no comments with regards to environmental review.

Retail/Ent,0595002,1600 JACKSON ST,0,PL FILED,05/24/2016 12:00:00 AM,,,,,,,,2016-000378PRJ,"The project site is located on the northwest corner of the Jackson Street and Polk Street in the Nob Hill neighborhood. The project site is occupied by a 48-foot-tall, two-story over basement, 43,898-gross-square-foot commercial building that has been vacant since 2014. The existing building was constructed in 1908 and was most recently occupied by a sporting goods store (""Lombardi Sports"").

The proposed project would convert the existing vacant building into a Whole Foods 365 Store. The ground floor would contain retail uses (12,301- square feet of occupied retail floor area), accessory storage, and a kitchen for preparing takeout, and a takeout area for customers to select packaged and self-serve hot and cold food to take out of the store or up to the second floor seating area, similar to other Whole Foods and 365 stores. The second floor would contain retail uses (8,779- square feet of occupied retail floor area), a seating area, storage, accessory office space, and space for mechanical equipment. The second floor would also include10,890-square feet of residential uses.

The second floor seating area would also serve as a community space for small, non-profit, community groups that are housed in the Middle Polk neighborhood, particularly during non-peak hours. The proposed project would maintain the existing 70-space parking garage (with access from Polk Street) and the existing off-street receiving area (with access from Jackson Street), and the project sponsor would request the extension of the existing 20-foot commercial loading zone on Jackson Street along the building frontage to 100 feet, via MTA's Color Curb Program. The proposed project would also add a bulb out to the corner of Jackson and Polk consistent with SFMTA standards. There are no parking spaces proposed for the residential component of the project.

The proposed project would convert one of the existing parking spaces in the garage to a carshare space and would designate two parking spaces for online food app. pickup. Drivers for food app pick-up and delivery use their personal vehicles. Deliveries may be made by one driver for one or for multiple orders, depending on demand for deliveries. The proposed project would also add 6 class 1, one cargo bike, and 5 hanging bicycle parking spaces to the garage. A total of 16 class 2 bike parking spaces would be added to the sidewalk, 8 on Jackson Street, and 8 on Polk Street. The proposed project would also add lockers, showers, and bike parking for 365 Store Team Members on the second floor.

Typical business hours would be approximately 8:00 a.m. to 10:00 p.m. daily. Business hours may be extended in advance of major holidays to accommodate increased demand and for the convenience of customers.
Inventory, restocking, and other similar store operations activities could occur at any time during a 24-hour period (see restrictions on delivery times, below). The 365 Store would have approximately 100-110 employees, with approximately 50 employees working on the busiest days.

The project sponsor has prepared a Transportation Management Plan for the proposed project. The Transportation Management Plan includes detailed information on the store's operations, truck routing, passenger loading operations, required SFMTA approvals, loading operations and schedule, the parking management plan, education program, monitoring activities, and transportation demand management measures.

The only alterations to the facade are the removal of film covering the existing windows and the installation of business identification signs. The proposed project would not entail building expansion or excavation, and no diesel back-up generators are proposed. Project construction is anticipated to be approximately 12 months.",,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0,,,,,,,NFOSTER,"Reuben, Junius, and Rose, LLP",,4155679000,3 - Northeast,3,Nob Hill,Russian Hill,,NCD-POLK,65-A,Downtown/Van Ness/Northeast Neighborhoods PDA,,37.79441164,-122.4217898,2019,Q3,2019_Q3,POINT (-122.4217898 37.79441164),105,105,4,3,32

This project requires a General Plan Referral because it requires a Major Encroachment Permit.
 
Eagle Plaza will transform a portion of 12th Street between Harrison and Bernice Streets in Western SoMa, within the Eastern Neighborhoods Plan Area, into a new public pedestrian-oriented plaza with both greening and LGBTQ/Leather pride commemorative elements. Significant greening is a primary aim of this project, given the dearth of public green space in Western SoMa. In addition to maintaining or replacing all existing trees on site and adding 5 net new trees, Eagle Plaza will create over 3,000 square feet of native, drought-tolerant vegetation where there was none before.
Equally importantly, Eagle Plaza is designed to be a physical commemoration and celebration of the rich LGBTQ and leather cultural history of the surrounding Folsom Gulch neighborhood. Such a space has been called for by the community and the City and, while Eagle Plaza is and always will be a public place welcoming to all ages and demographics, several elements will highlight this important LGBTQ and leather heritage. A central flagpole flying the leather pride flag will build the plaza?s identity, similar to the rainbow pride flag?s role in the Castro. As a playful nod to the area?s history and the Folsom Street Fair, the paving will be dark with inlaid metal ?studs.? In addition, the neighborhood stage area located outside the SF Eagle would be a place for community events featuring local artists, musicians, speakers, and more.

Eagle Plaza will fill important unmet needs in Western SoMa, both for new public green space and for commemoration of Folsom Gulch?s rich LGBTQ heritage. These needs have been identified in multiple City planning documents:

Fig & Thistle Apothecary) measuring roughly 500 square feet at the ground level (fronting Ivy Street) In the Hayes Valley neighborhood. The neighborhood is a mixed-use commercial district that contains a limited range of retail commercial activity, which primarily caters to the immediate need of the neighborhood. The few comparison goods that it does provide attract clientele from a wider area outside its neighborhood, mostly the Performing Arts and Civic Center workers and visitors. 

The proposal will involve minor interior tenant improvement and will not expand the existing space. The store-front is currently used as a wine bar (d.b.a. Fig & Thistle) which is also owned by the applicant. The subject building is a three story commercial building located on the corner of Gough and Ivy Streets and is improved with two ground floor commercial store-fronts and medical offices on the second and third floors. No residential units are present. 

The operators have operated their our current business in Hayes Valley for over 6 years and are very active in the neighborhood as a stake-holder participating with the various neighborhood associations. As stake-holders we stay engaged with the community and our neighbors by contributing to the various schools and nonprofits with donations for fundraisers to volunteering our time with the kids at the boys and girls club. We hope to continue our involvement with the community with the dispensary by working on outreach and education to the community about the positive and medicinal uses of cannabis.

The project site is located on the block bounded by Pacific Avenue to the north, Jackson Street to the south, Van Ness Avenue to the west, and Polk Street to the east. The project site is currently developed with an approximately 12,409-gross-square-foot (gsf), 32-foot-tall, one-story-with-mezzanine building with former office (670 gross square feet), industrial (6,625 gross square feet automotive repair), and retail-restaurant/bar/place-of-entertainment (5,113 gross square feet) uses. 

The proposed project would demolish the existing structures and construct an approximately 49,268-gross-square-foot, seven-story 72-foot-tall (up to 80 feet tall including parapets, stairs, boiler room, and elevator penthouse) residential mixed-use building with retail and residential on the ground floor and a one-level basement with residential vehicular parking. The residential portion of the proposed project would accommodate approximately 46 one-bedroom apartments, 11 two-bedroom apartments, and six three-bedroom apartments, for a total of up to approximately 63 residential dwelling units. The retail portion of the proposed project would be comprised of up to an approximately 874-square-foot area on the ground floor. The new approximately 8,705-square-foot basement would provide space for storage and an approximately 6,099-square-foot garage for 24 vehicles. The new garage would be accessed via a new curb cut on Pacific Avenue up to 14 feet in width, replacing an existing 11-foot-4-inch-wide curb cut in approximately the same location. The proposed passenger loading would occur on Pacific Avenue at the northeast site frontage. The project would replace one Pacific Avenue on-street metered parking space with one on-street passenger loading space (approximately 20-feet long), and add new street trees. Approximately 64 class-1 bicycle parking spaces would be provided within the basement of the building, and six class-2 bicycle parking spaces (four residential and two retail) would be installed on the adjacent sidewalks. The proposed project would include excavation of approximately 5,268 cubic yards (8,436 square feet) of material, in a 1,666-square-foot area, to a maximum depth of 22 feet below grade. Up to approximately four new street trees would be planted (approximately five on Pacific Avenue and one on Van Ness Avenue).

The lot is occupied by a 21-foot tall, one-story over basement, 1,500-gross-square-foot, single family residential building constructed in 1913, and a small outbuilding. The site is adjacent to single family residences on either side.  The proposed project would demolish the existing residential building and outbuilding, and construct a two-story, 37-foot-tall, 2,900 gross-square-foot residence over a basement. The proposed single-family home would have four bedrooms and three and a half bathrooms, including one bed and one bath on the basement level. 

The existing 486-square-foot basement is partially built into the grade of the lot and would be expanded to 718 square feet, by extending the basement 16 feet at the back to a depth of 11 feet below grade, and by extending the basement 5 feet towards the Diamond Street property line at existing grade, and would use existing retaining walls. The basement would provide one vehicle parking space, one Class I bicycle parking space, and would include one  bedroom and one bathroom.  

The proposed project would remove the existing nine-foot curb cut for the one-car garage, and construct a new 10-foot curb cut in the middle of the property for similar access.  The project proposes to remove the existing street tree located within the public right-of-way and would plant a street tree a few feet to the north of the existing location. Tree removal and replacement would be subject to requirements of the Urban Forestry Ordinance.

The lot contains areas with greater than 25 percent slope, and therefore the project may be subject to requirements of the San Francisco?s Slope and Seismic Hazards Zone Protection Act. The proposed project would require 75 cubic yards of excavation up to 11 feet below grade, as well as construction of a new retaining wall in the upslope portion of the backyard along the east property line. The geotechnical report specifies the proposed improvements can be supported on a mat foundation or a grid of interconnected footings. Where artificial fill or soft to medium stiff native soil is exposed, the proposed foundations should be deepened or drilled piers can be used to transfer the building loads to the underlying bedrock.
