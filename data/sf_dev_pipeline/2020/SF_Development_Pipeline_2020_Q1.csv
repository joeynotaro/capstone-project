Vacant,6713044,2555 DIAMOND ST,0,PL Filed,2018-11-02,1,0,,0,,,,2018-015058PRJ,"The project site is located on the east side of Diamond Street, approximately 200 feet south of the intersection with Moffitt Street, on a 2,500 square-foot upsloping lot in the Glen Park neighborhood. The lot is occupied by a 21-foot tall, one-story over basement, 1,500-gross-square-foot, single family residential building constructed in 1913, and a small outbuilding. The site is adjacent to single family residences on either side.  The proposed project would demolish the existing residential building and outbuilding, and construct a two-story, 37-foot-tall, 2,900 gross-square-foot residence over a basement. The proposed single-family home would have four bedrooms and three and a half bathrooms, including one bed and one bath on the basement level. 

The existing 486-square-foot basement is partially built into the grade of the lot and would be expanded to 718 square feet, by extending the basement 16 feet at the back to a depth of 11 feet below grade, and by extending the basement 5 feet towards the Diamond Street property line at existing grade, and would use existing retaining walls. The basement would provide one vehicle parking space, one Class I bicycle parking space, and would include one  bedroom and one bathroom.  

The proposed project would remove the existing nine-foot curb cut for the one-car garage, and construct a new 10-foot curb cut in the middle of the property for similar access.  The project proposes to remove the existing street tree located within the public right-of-way and would plant a street tree a few feet to the north of the existing location. Tree removal and replacement would be subject to requirements of the Urban Forestry Ordinance.

The lot contains areas with greater than 25 percent slope, and therefore the project may be subject to requirements of the San Francisco?s Slope and Seismic Hazards Zone Protection Act. The proposed project would require 75 cubic yards of excavation up to 11 feet below grade, as well as construction of a new retaining wall in the upslope portion of the backyard along the east property line. The geotechnical report specifies the proposed improvements can be supported on a mat foundation or a grid of interconnected footings. Where artificial fill or soft to medium stiff native soil is exposed, the proposed foundations should be deepened or drilled piers can be used to transfer the building loads to the underlying bedrock.

In addition to RCFE and skilled nursing facilities, the Home also plans to make available approximately 45,100 square feet of existing and new facilities to ?The Square?, providing personal services such as a fitness center, medical offices, and recreational facilities, to seniors across the City. Approximately 58 additional parking spaces, for a total 224 parking spaces, 25 Class 1 and 14 Class 2 bicycle parking spaces would be added to the site, to accommodate the additional residents, visitors, staff and Square users. The new buildings front Mission Street and Avalon Avenue, and will provide up to 4,600 square feet of ground floor retail along Mission Street, bringing active uses to the street.  The proposed building along Mission Street is 6 stories, reaching approximately 80-feet.

The lot is L-shaped, with approximately 92 feet of frontage along North Point Street and approximately 46 feet of frontage along Larkin Street. There are three lots at the corner of Larkin Street and North Point Street that separate the two frontages. The site is moderately upsloping along Larkin Street, moving south from North Point Street to Bay Street. The project site is within a NC-1, Neighborhood Commercial Cluster District and a 40-X Height and Bulk District.

An approximately 29,400-square foot parking garage, constructed in 1925, currently occupies the project site. The garage frontage is two-stories tall on North Point Street. Along Larkin Street, the lower floor of the garage is semi-subterranean, such that the frontage is one story tall. Access to the garage is provided via a curb cut and vehicular entrance on North Point Street, with an exit via curb cut on Larkin Street. A third curb cut on North Point Street is presently disused. The garage provides 65 spaces of pre-reserved monthly paid parking. 

The project would demolish the existing garage and construct two four-story, 40-foot-tall buildings (with maximum height of 46 feet for roof extensions and appurtenances). The two proposed buildings would be connected at the parking level, which would serve as the base for both buildings. Due to the grade change of the project site, this would be the ground level for the proposed building along North Point Street and a subterranean basement level for the proposed building along Larkin Street. In combination, the two proposed buildings would provide approximately 45,300 gsf of development, including approximately 12,700 square feet (sf) for a semi-subterranean parking garage, approximately 26,000 sf to accommodate 37 dwelling units, and approximately 1,300 sf of ground floor retail space.  The residential unit mix would consist of 13 studios, 13 one-bedrooms, 7 two-bedrooms, and 4 three-bedrooms units. The garage would provide 28 vehicle parking spaces, 57 class 1 bicycle parking spaces, and garbage and recycling collection areas, with vehicle entrance via a new 10-foot-wide curb cut near the western edge of the North Point Street frontage. The project also would provide eight class 2 bicycle parking spaces along North Point Street.  The building along North Point Street would contain a ground floor commercial space and a residential lobby entry for the residential units within the North Point building. A separate residential entry would also be provided for the building along Larkin Street including two units that have direct walk-up access. Each building would have an elevator and stairwell, and direct pedestrian and bicycle access to the shared garage. The project proposes a total of 2,000 sf of common open space including approximately 1,500 sf of common open space on the second level (atop the semi-subterranean garage) that would be shared between the two buildings and would be accessible from both, and an approximately 500 sf common open space deck on the fourth level of the proposed Larkin Street building. Decks, patios, and stoops within various levels of the two buildings would provide a total of about 2,700 sf of private open spaces. Consistent with the Better Roofs Ordinance, solar thermal panels would be provided on the North Point Street building roof.

Construction would require approximately 650 cubic yards of soil excavation. The depth of excavation is proposed at a maximum of 3 to 8 feet below ground surface within a 5,700 sf area.

The project site includes lot 1 (5 Joy Street), lot 4 (9 Joy Street), lot 5 (15 Joy Street), and lot 6 (21 Joy Street). The project lots are all located on the south side of Joy Street between Brewster Street and Holladay Avenue. Lots 4, 5, and 6 are only accessible by the existing Joy Street pedestrian stairs. The project sponsor proposes the construction of four single-family residences, one on each lot.  The proposed residences on lots 1, 4, and 6 would be 30 feet tall with two stories over a basement level while the proposed residence on lot 5 would be 30 feet tall with three stories. The proposed buildings would range in size from approximately 1,960 square feet to 2,130 square feet.

This project requires a General Plan Referral because it requires a Major Encroachment Permit.
 
Eagle Plaza will transform a portion of 12th Street between Harrison and Bernice Streets in Western SoMa, within the Eastern Neighborhoods Plan Area, into a new public pedestrian-oriented plaza with both greening and LGBTQ/Leather pride commemorative elements. Significant greening is a primary aim of this project, given the dearth of public green space in Western SoMa. In addition to maintaining or replacing all existing trees on site and adding 5 net new trees, Eagle Plaza will create over 3,000 square feet of native, drought-tolerant vegetation where there was none before.
Equally importantly, Eagle Plaza is designed to be a physical commemoration and celebration of the rich LGBTQ and leather cultural history of the surrounding Folsom Gulch neighborhood. Such a space has been called for by the community and the City and, while Eagle Plaza is and always will be a public place welcoming to all ages and demographics, several elements will highlight this important LGBTQ and leather heritage. A central flagpole flying the leather pride flag will build the plaza?s identity, similar to the rainbow pride flag?s role in the Castro. As a playful nod to the area?s history and the Folsom Street Fair, the paving will be dark with inlaid metal ?studs.? In addition, the neighborhood stage area located outside the SF Eagle would be a place for community events featuring local artists, musicians, speakers, and more.

Eagle Plaza will fill important unmet needs in Western SoMa, both for new public green space and for commemoration of Folsom Gulch?s rich LGBTQ heritage. These needs have been identified in multiple City planning documents:

Fig & Thistle Apothecary) measuring roughly 500 square feet at the ground level (fronting Ivy Street) In the Hayes Valley neighborhood. The neighborhood is a mixed-use commercial district that contains a limited range of retail commercial activity, which primarily caters to the immediate need of the neighborhood. The few comparison goods that it does provide attract clientele from a wider area outside its neighborhood, mostly the Performing Arts and Civic Center workers and visitors. 

The proposal will involve minor interior tenant improvement and will not expand the existing space. The store-front is currently used as a wine bar (d.b.a. Fig & Thistle) which is also owned by the applicant. The subject building is a three story commercial building located on the corner of Gough and Ivy Streets and is improved with two ground floor commercial store-fronts and medical offices on the second and third floors. No residential units are present. 

The operators have operated their our current business in Hayes Valley for over 6 years and are very active in the neighborhood as a stake-holder participating with the various neighborhood associations. As stake-holders we stay engaged with the community and our neighbors by contributing to the various schools and nonprofits with donations for fundraisers to volunteering our time with the kids at the boys and girls club. We hope to continue our involvement with the community with the dispensary by working on outreach and education to the community about the positive and medicinal uses of cannabis. We are native San Franciscans that have been constantly working to contribute to the betterment of the city by opening business that can hire from the community and build pathways for our workers to grow and move forward.",,8000,0,,0,0,,0,0,,5000,0,,0,0,,3000,0,,0,,0,0,,,,BHICKS,415 Native dba Fig & Thistle Apothe,,4157067014,,2020,Q1,2020_Q1,5 - Western Addition,5,Western Addition,Hayes Valley,Market and Octavia; Market and Octavia Living Alleys,NCT-HAYES,50-X,Market Octavia,,37.77723488,-122.4233149,POINT (-122.4233149 37.77723488),22,22,4,11,9

The lot is occupied by a two-story 10,020-gross-square-foot, commercial building constructed in 1900, and a small surface parking lot with seven parking spaces. The site is adjacent to a mixed-use, four-story apartment building at 1424-1428 Polk Street that is an historic resource.

The proposed project would demolish the existing commercial building constructed in 1900, and construct an eight-story over partial basement (lower ground level), approximately 80-foot-tall (88-foot with penthouse), 106,733 gross-square-foot mixed-use building including 9,823 gross square-feet of ground floor commercial and 100 dwelling units. The partial basement would contain 101 Class 1 and no vehicle parking. The proposed project would include 20 studio units, 29 one-bedroom units, 39 two-bedroom units and 12 three-bedroom units. 

The proposed project would include 10 class 2 bicycle spaces on the sidewalks along California Street and Polk Street. An existing curb cut at the eastern edge of the property along California Street would be converted to an on-street parking space. An existing on-street parking space on California street would be converted to a white passenger loading zone. The proposed project would include a new 3-foot permeable paver strip along the southwest corner of the project site and new 3-feet by 3-feet scored concrete sidewalk within the northern and western sides of the project site. The existing bulb out and curb ramps at the corner of California and Polk streets would remain. The proposed project would include new landscaping consisting of five new street trees along California Street and one new street tree on Polk Street and 10 Class 2 bicycle parking spaces.

The project proposes to use the State Density Bonus Law to permit seven bonus units (93 units are principally permitted) and is requesting waivers from: 1) Rear Yard (Section 134), 2) Open Space (Section 135), 3) Exposure (Section 140), and 4) Bulk (Section 270); additionally the project sponsor requests one incentive or concession from Ground Floor Ceiling Height (Section 145.1). The project sponsor is seeking a Conditional Use Authorization pursuant to Planning Code Sections 121.1, 121.7, and 303.

Construction of the building would take place over a period two years. The proposed building would be supported on a mat foundation over drilled displacement piers for ground improvement, as recommend in the geotechnical report. Piers would be set back 10 feet from the adjacent Polk Street building.",,10020,-1726,,,0,,,0,,,0,,,0,,9823,-1923,,0,,,0,,,,APERRY,Farella Braun & Martel LLP,,4159544902,,2020,Q1,2020_Q1,3 - Northeast,3,Nob Hill,Nob Hill,,NCD-POLK,80-A,Downtown/Van Ness/Northeast Neighborhoods,,37.79034813,-122.4201002,POINT (-122.4201002 37.79034813),105,105,4,3,21

The site is also located within the Kearny-Market-Mason-Sutter Conservation District. The existing seven-story, 242,730-square-foot (sf) building, constructed in 1974, consists of approximately 163,000 sf of retail use and 54,000 sf of accessory office use. The proposed project would convert the existing single-tenant building into a multi-tenant building consisting of retail, restaurant, and office uses. Floors 1-3 and the basement level would continue as retail use, but would be reconfigured to provide multiple tenant spaces with storefronts and public access along Stockton and O'Farrell Streets. Existing retail use would also be reconfigured on floors 4-6 to provide for multiple tenants. The project would include a change of use of 49,999 sf of retail use into office use on floors 6-7. A new roof top addition of approximately 10,800 sf is proposed for restaurant use. It would increase the building's total height from about 104 feet to 120 feet. The gross square footage for the proposed reconfigured building would be approximately 246,800 sf.

Proposed streetscape improvements include three new street lights, one existing relocated streetlight, and about 10 new street trees. All improvements would be coordinated with the SFMTA's Central Subway project plans. There is no existing or proposed off-street vehicle parking, but the project would request the SFMTA to install 28 class 2 on-street bicycle parking spaces in dual bike racks on Stockton and O'Farrell Streets, and would also install 30 class 1 bicycle spaces in the basement level. The existing uses are served by a loading dock containing three loading bays accessed from the narrow Security Pacific Place. This loading dock would be reconfigured for two loading bays and one service bay.

The project would require excavation of approximately 4,300 cubic yards of soil for structural upgrades to the building that would include perimeter tie beams, shear wall, and a sewage ejector and grease interceptor. The depth of excavation would extend to 12 feet below the existing basement. No particularly noisy equipment or impact equipment/devices would be required for construction of the proposed improvements. Construction activities would include demolition, site preparation, grading, interior and exterior upgrades to be completed in overlapping phases commencing in March 2019 and anticipated to be completed in May 2021.",,206840,-10141,,,0,,,0,,49999,-3890,,,0,,156841,-6251,,0,,,0,,,,RSALGADO,"Reuben, Junius & Rose, LLP",Tuija Catalano,4155679000,,2020,Q1,2020_Q1,4 - Downtown,3,Financial District,Financial District/South Beach,Downtown Streetscape Plan; Downtown,C-3-R,80-130-F,Downtown/Van Ness/Northeast Neighborhoods,,37.78698462,-122.4059666,POINT (-122.4059666 37.78698462),19,19,6,3,8

The project site is occupied by a 48-foot-tall, two-story over basement, 43,898-gross-square-foot commercial building that has been vacant since 2014. The existing building was constructed in 1908 and was most recently occupied by a sporting goods store (""Lombardi Sports"").

The proposed project would convert the existing vacant building into a Whole Foods 365 Store. The ground floor would contain retail uses (12,301- square feet of occupied retail floor area), accessory storage, and a kitchen for preparing takeout, and a takeout area for customers to select packaged and self-serve hot and cold food to take out of the store or up to the second floor seating area, similar to other Whole Foods and 365 stores. The second floor would contain retail uses (8,779- square feet of occupied retail floor area), a seating area, storage, accessory office space, and space for mechanical equipment. The second floor would also include10,890-square feet of residential uses.

The second floor seating area would also serve as a community space for small, non-profit, community groups that are housed in the Middle Polk neighborhood, particularly during non-peak hours. The proposed project would maintain the existing 70-space parking garage (with access from Polk Street) and the existing off-street receiving area (with access from Jackson Street), and the project sponsor would request the extension of the existing 20-foot commercial loading zone on Jackson Street along the building frontage to 100 feet, via MTA's Color Curb Program. The proposed project would also add a bulb out to the corner of Jackson and Polk consistent with SFMTA standards. There are no parking spaces proposed for the residential component of the project.

The proposed project would convert one of the existing parking spaces in the garage to a carshare space and would designate two parking spaces for online food app. pickup. Drivers for food app pick-up and delivery use their personal vehicles. Deliveries may be made by one driver for one or for multiple orders, depending on demand for deliveries. The proposed project would also add 6 class 1, one cargo bike, and 5 hanging bicycle parking spaces to the garage. A total of 16 class 2 bike parking spaces would be added to the sidewalk, 8 on Jackson Street, and 8 on Polk Street. The proposed project would also add lockers, showers, and bike parking for 365 Store Team Members on the second floor.

Typical business hours would be approximately 8:00 a.m. to 10:00 p.m. daily. Business hours may be extended in advance of major holidays to accommodate increased demand and for the convenience of customers.
Inventory, restocking, and other similar store operations activities could occur at any time during a 24-hour period (see restrictions on delivery times, below). The 365 Store would have approximately 100-110 employees, with approximately 50 employees working on the busiest days.

The project sponsor has prepared a Transportation Management Plan for the proposed project. The Transportation Management Plan includes detailed information on the store's operations, truck routing, passenger loading operations, required SFMTA approvals, loading operations and schedule, the parking management plan, education program, monitoring activities, and transportation demand management measures.

The only alterations to the facade are the removal of film covering the existing windows and the installation of business identification signs. The proposed project would not entail building expansion or excavation, and no diesel back-up generators are proposed. Project construction is anticipated to be approximately 12 months.",,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0,,,,,,,NFOSTER,"Reuben, Junius, and Rose, LLP",,4155679000,,2020,Q1,2020_Q1,3 - Northeast,3,Nob Hill,Russian Hill,,NCD-POLK,65-A,Downtown/Van Ness/Northeast Neighborhoods,,37.79441659,-122.421803,POINT (-122.421803 37.79441659),105,105,4,3,32

The project site is a through lot, with frontages on Jerrold Avenue and Bayshore Boulevard. The block is bounded by Jerrold Avenue to the northeast, Barneveld Avenue to the east, Oakdale Avenue to the south, and Bayshore Boulevard to the west. The existing project site includes approximately 9,000 square-foot warehouse building and an approximately 5,000 square foot office building. The project would be completed by San Francisco Public Works department and will implement Standard Construction Measures for Public Works projects.

The proposed project consists of a temporary Navigation Center, providing temporary (approximately 4 years) housing and social services to the homeless (approximately 128 beds). The project involves interior tenant improvements within the existing warehouse building to create an insulated, conditioned dormitory space and associated improvements to provide natural light and access to the building. Modular buildings would be added to the properties and placed both outside, and connected to the exterior of the existing warehouse building. These modular buildings would provide showers, restrooms, and other accessory uses. Landscaping improvements along with the construction of a deck would also occur to create use-able outdoor space. The existing approximately 5,000 square-foot office space would remain as is with interior tenant improvements, and be used by the Navigation Center. 
The project would not include any expansion of the existing buildings (other than the temporary modular buildings connected to the existing warehouse building) and no permanent structures would be constructed as part of this project. 
A notification of the project receiving Environmental Review went out on 3/9/2018. There were no comments with regards to environmental review.

The project site is occupied by a 27-foot-tall, two-story over basement, industrial building that is approximately 13,710 gross square feet in size with 12 below-grade parking spaces. The existing automobile repair garage building was constructed in circa 1914 and is currently vacant (formerly occupied by ?Green Street Auto Body?). 

The project sponsor proposes a two-story vertical addition and a change of use to convert the existing automotive garage to a new residential development with five residential units. The project would add approximately 13,408 gross square feet to the existing building. The project includes 1,369 square feet of common open space in the form of a roof deck, and 2,265 square feet of private open space via balconies and terraces. The project includes alterations to the front facade, including the restoration of two pilasters that were removed from the central arch to allow for a wider garage opening during a 1933 alteration. With the proposed improvements, the building would be 40 feet tall (53 feet tall with elevator penthouse) and 27,118 gross square feet in size with 10 below-grade parking spaces and five class 1 bicycle parking spaces. In addition, the project includes the expansion of the existing basement by 1,615 square feet (from 5,516 square feet to 7,131 square feet). Project construction would require up to approximately 15 feet of excavation below ground surface, resulting in approximately 1,400 cubic yards of soil disturbance. Conventional hand-excavated end-bearing piers would be used for the proposed underpinning system. Heavy equipment would not be used within 10 horizontal feet from adjacent shallow foundations and basement walls; jumping jack or hand-operated vibratory plate compactors would be used for compacting fill within this zone. The project site is listed as an active leaking underground storage tank cleanup site on the Hazardous Waste and Substances Sites List (also known as the ?Cortese List?).","PROPOSAL IS TO MAINTAIN (E) GARAGE WALLS & CONSTRUCT (5) (N) RESIGENTIAL UNITS WITHIN (E) STRUCTURE & IN A TWO-STORY VERTICAL ADDITION.

The proposed project would involve both interior and exterior tenant improvements to the existing four-story-over-garage building and remodeling of the basement, with no expansion of the existing building envelope. The proposed project would involve a change of use of approximately 32,600 square feet of space in the building which is currently used as a public parking garage into office use at the basement and ground floors, with the addition of an approximately 5,000 square foot mezzanine level with office uses and approximately 1,000 square feet of retail use on the ground floor. The proposed project would also raise the ground floor slab to provide adequate ceiling heights for the basement area and provide stairs and a limited-use elevator to link the new ground floor with the basement and mezzanine. Project construction would be expected to require excavation to a depth of 3 feet over the approximately 17,900 square foot site, resulting in excavation of 1,985 cubic yards of soil for ground floor slab improvements. The proposed project would also infill the three existing parking entrances onto the street with new windows and doors, eliminate the three existing curb cuts and 185 parking spaces, and add 7 Class I bicycle parking spaces. The project sponsor would apply to SFMTA for a 44 foot-long passenger loading zone at the main building entrance on Taylor Street.
