The proposed new building would include 269,296 square feet of tenant office space.  At ground floor, mezzanine, and basement, 3,272 square feet of retail sales and service, 13,529 sf of Art-focused PDR, 3,000 sf of Child Care facility, 5 loading spaces, 21 vehicular parking spaces, and 86 bicycle parking spaces are provided. 

The proposal also provides 6,267 sf of public open space with 1,000 sf as Child Care Outdoor space and 4,817 sf as Privately Owned Public Open Space (POPOS). Mostly as Open-to-Sky, this POPOS + Child Care open space is provided as 30 feet-wide Mid-Block Alley between Brannan Street and Freelon Street along north side of lot with mainly pedestrian access. Various setbacks and street widening are provided per planning requirement to accommodate expected high pedestrian traffic from newly constructed MUNI station at corner of 4th and Brannan. 

The project is subject to a 200-CS height/bulk district.  While a 200 foot tall tower, subject to the tower massing and bulk controls in Sections 132.4 and 270(h), could be proposed at this site, the proposed project is designed as a mid-rise building.  The building is proposed at a height of 185 feet and is designed in consideration of the skyplane controls that apply to mid-rise buildings.  This is consistent with the precedent set with the Key Site projects approved at 4th/Harrison Street and 88 Bluxome Street, where those buildings were subject to a 160 foot height limit, but were able to take advantage of the Central SoMa SUD 25 foot height bump for a total of 185 feet in height (at 88 Bluxome Street, this applied to one of the three buildings).  Despite being 185 feet tall (25 feet taller than the maximum height for a mid-rise building), those projects were still reviewed as mid-rise buildings, subject to the massing controls in Section 132.4 and the skyplane controls of Section 270(h).

Therefore, we are seeking review of the 185-foot project as a mid-rise building instead of a tower.  The proposed project has been designed as a mid-rise building and complies with all Section 132.4 massing restrictions on mid-rise buildings and propose minor deviations from the Section 270 skyplane requirements (described in detail later in the application).  The deviation from the strict skyplane controls along Brannan Street is acknowledged in the Key Site Guidelines for this site in exchange for providing more light and air on Freelon Street than would otherwise be provided by a tower project.  The proposed project provides triple the amount of light and air along Freelon Street than a 200 foot tower.  This significantly greater light and air justifies the exception to skyplane along 4th Street as well. The project fully achieves the Guidelines goals of emphasizing the importance of the corner at 4th and Brannan Streets, by creating a vertical massing expression that acts as a urban beacon and ""holds"" the urban corner.",,286097,280097,,0,0,,0,0,,269296,265296,,13529,13529,,3272,1272,,0,,0,0,0,0,0,XLIANG,Strada Investment Group,Clarke Miller,4155727640,,2020,Q4,2020_Q4,9 - South of Market,6,Matt Haney,South of Market,South of Market,Central SoMa,CMUO,200-CS,Eastern Neighborhoods PDA,Central SoMa,37.7788631501,-122.396444358,POINT (-122.396444358 37.7788631501),32,32,1,10,34

The project site is occupied by a 48-foot-tall, two-story over basement, 43,898-gross-square-foot commercial building that has been vacant since 2014. The existing building was constructed in 1908 and was most recently occupied by a sporting goods store (""Lombardi Sports"").

The proposed project would convert the existing vacant building into a Whole Foods 365 Store. The ground floor would contain retail uses (12,301- square feet of occupied retail floor area), accessory storage, and a kitchen for preparing takeout, and a takeout area for customers to select packaged and self-serve hot and cold food to take out of the store or up to the second floor seating area, similar to other Whole Foods and 365 stores. The second floor would contain retail uses (8,779- square feet of occupied retail floor area), a seating area, storage, accessory office space, and space for mechanical equipment. The second floor would also include10,890-square feet of residential uses.

The second floor seating area would also serve as a community space for small, non-profit, community groups that are housed in the Middle Polk neighborhood, particularly during non-peak hours. The proposed project would maintain the existing 70-space parking garage (with access from Polk Street) and the existing off-street receiving area (with access from Jackson Street), and the project sponsor would request the extension of the existing 20-foot commercial loading zone on Jackson Street along the building frontage to 100 feet, via MTA's Color Curb Program. The proposed project would also add a bulb out to the corner of Jackson and Polk consistent with SFMTA standards. There are no parking spaces proposed for the residential component of the project.

The proposed project would convert one of the existing parking spaces in the garage to a carshare space and would designate two parking spaces for online food app. pickup. Drivers for food app pick-up and delivery use their personal vehicles. Deliveries may be made by one driver for one or for multiple orders, depending on demand for deliveries. The proposed project would also add 6 class 1, one cargo bike, and 5 hanging bicycle parking spaces to the garage. A total of 16 class 2 bike parking spaces would be added to the sidewalk, 8 on Jackson Street, and 8 on Polk Street. The proposed project would also add lockers, showers, and bike parking for 365 Store Team Members on the second floor.

Typical business hours would be approximately 8:00 a.m. to 10:00 p.m. daily. Business hours may be extended in advance of major holidays to accommodate increased demand and for the convenience of customers.
Inventory, restocking, and other similar store operations activities could occur at any time during a 24-hour period (see restrictions on delivery times, below). The 365 Store would have approximately 100-110 employees, with approximately 50 employees working on the busiest days.

The project sponsor has prepared a Transportation Management Plan for the proposed project. The Transportation Management Plan includes detailed information on the store's operations, truck routing, passenger loading operations, required SFMTA approvals, loading operations and schedule, the parking management plan, education program, monitoring activities, and transportation demand management measures.

The only alterations to the facade are the removal of film covering the existing windows and the installation of business identification signs.

The lot is occupied by a 21-foot tall, one-story over basement, 1,500-gross-square-foot, single family residential building constructed in 1913, and a small outbuilding. The site is adjacent to single family residences on either side.  The proposed project would demolish the existing residential building and outbuilding, and construct a two-story, 37-foot-tall, 2,900 gross-square-foot residence over a basement. The proposed single-family home would have four bedrooms and three and a half bathrooms, including one bed and one bath on the basement level. 

The existing 486-square-foot basement is partially built into the grade of the lot and would be expanded to 718 square feet, by extending the basement 16 feet at the back to a depth of 11 feet below grade, and by extending the basement 5 feet towards the Diamond Street property line at existing grade, and would use existing retaining walls. The basement would provide one vehicle parking space, one Class I bicycle parking space, and would include one  bedroom and one bathroom.  

The proposed project would remove the existing nine-foot curb cut for the one-car garage, and construct a new 10-foot curb cut in the middle of the property for similar access.  The project proposes to remove the existing street tree located within the public right-of-way and would plant a street tree a few feet to the north of the existing location. Tree removal and replacement would be subject to requirements of the Urban Forestry Ordinance.

The lot contains areas with greater than 25 percent slope, and therefore the project may be subject to requirements of the San Francisco?s Slope and Seismic Hazards Zone Protection Act. The proposed project would require 75 cubic yards of excavation up to 11 feet below grade, as well as construction of a new retaining wall in the upslope portion of the backyard along the east property line. The geotechnical report specifies the proposed improvements can be supported on a mat foundation or a grid of interconnected footings. Where artificial fill or soft to medium stiff native soil is exposed, the proposed foundations should be deepened or drilled piers can be used to transfer the building loads to the underlying bedrock.

The lot is occupied by a two-story 10,020-gross-square-foot, commercial building constructed in 1900, and a small surface parking lot with seven parking spaces. The site is adjacent to a mixed-use, four-story apartment building at 1424-1428 Polk Street that is an historic resource.

The proposed project would demolish the existing commercial building constructed in 1900, and construct an eight-story over partial basement (lower ground level), approximately 80-foot-tall (88-foot with penthouse), 106,733 gross-square-foot mixed-use building including 9,823 gross square-feet of ground floor commercial and 100 dwelling units. The partial basement would contain 101 Class 1 and no vehicle parking. The proposed project would include 20 studio units, 29 one-bedroom units, 39 two-bedroom units and 12 three-bedroom units. 

The proposed project would include 10 class 2 bicycle spaces on the sidewalks along California Street and Polk Street. An existing curb cut at the eastern edge of the property along California Street would be converted to an on-street parking space. An existing on-street parking space on California street would be converted to a white passenger loading zone. The proposed project would include a new 3-foot permeable paver strip along the southwest corner of the project site and new 3-feet by 3-feet scored concrete sidewalk within the northern and western sides of the project site. The existing bulb out and curb ramps at the corner of California and Polk streets would remain. The proposed project would include new landscaping consisting of five new street trees along California Street and one new street tree on Polk Street and 10 Class 2 bicycle parking spaces.

The project proposes to use the State Density Bonus Law to permit seven bonus units (93 units are principally permitted) and is requesting waivers from: 1) Rear Yard (Section 134), 2) Open Space (Section 135), 3) Exposure (Section 140), and 4) Bulk (Section 270); additionally the project sponsor requests one incentive or concession from Ground Floor Ceiling Height (Section 145.1). The project sponsor is seeking a Conditional Use Authorization pursuant to Planning Code Sections 121.1, 121.7, and 303.

Construction of the building would take place over a period two years. The proposed building would be supported on a mat foundation over drilled displacement piers for ground improvement, as recommend in the geotechnical report. Piers would be set back 10 feet from the adjacent Polk Street building.",,9823,-1923,,,0,,,0,,,0,,,0,,8639,-3107,,0,,,0,,,,APERRY,Farella Braun & Martel LLP,,4159544902,,2020,Q4,2020_Q4,3 - Northeast,3,Aaron Peskin,Nob Hill,Nob Hill,,NCD-POLK,80-A,Downtown/Van Ness/Northeast Neighborhoods PDA,,37.7903431862,-122.420087012,POINT (-122.420087012 37.7903431862),105,105,4,3,21

Fig & Thistle Apothecary) measuring roughly 500 square feet at the ground level (fronting Ivy Street) In the Hayes Valley neighborhood. The neighborhood is a mixed-use commercial district that contains a limited range of retail commercial activity, which primarily caters to the immediate need of the neighborhood. The few comparison goods that it does provide attract clientele from a wider area outside its neighborhood, mostly the Performing Arts and Civic Center workers and visitors. 

The proposal will involve minor interior tenant improvement and will not expand the existing space. The store-front is currently used as a wine bar (d.b.a. Fig & Thistle) which is also owned by the applicant. The subject building is a three story commercial building located on the corner of Gough and Ivy Streets and is improved with two ground floor commercial store-fronts and medical offices on the second and third floors. No residential units are present. 

The operators have operated their our current business in Hayes Valley for over 6 years and are very active in the neighborhood as a stake-holder participating with the various neighborhood associations. As stake-holders we stay engaged with the community and our neighbors by contributing to the various schools and nonprofits with donations for fundraisers to volunteering our time with the kids at the boys and girls club. We hope to continue our involvement with the community with the dispensary by working on outreach and education to the community about the positive and medicinal uses of cannabis.

The proposed project would demolish an existing car wash and gas station, a two-story, three-unit residential building (1052 Oak Street), and a two-story, two-unit residential building (1048-50 Oak Street). The existing two-story, two-unit residential building at 1060-1062 Oak Street constructed in 1900 is a historic resource, and would be relocated 49 feet east of its present location on Oak Street as part of the project. The project would construct a 3- to- 6-story, 40-foot to 65-foot-tall (81 feet at the top of the elevator penthouse), mixed-use building, with 184 residential units above 8,100 gross square feet (gsf) of ground floor retail with frontages on Divisadero and Oak Streets ? see project plans dated April 23, 2019. 

The proposed 150,000 gross square foot building would include 89 studios, 21 one-bedroom, and 74 two-bedroom units. The two existing three-bedroom units within the 1060-1062 Oak Street building would be retained. A total of 15,268 square feet of common open space would be provided in a rear yard, a second floor courtyard, and a roof deck, and 2,403 square feet of private open space in a combination of patios and balconies.  A residential lobby would be located on the ground-floor with access from Oak Street. A ground-floor bicycle storage room would provide 170 Class I bicycle parking spaces. A ground-floor parking garage would provide 56 parking spaces, one car-share space, and a single commercial loading space, with access via a proposed 18-foot curb cut on Oak Street, 150 feet east of the intersection of Oak and Divisadero streets. Seven existing curb cuts would be removed. Fourteen Class II bicycle parking spaces and 14 street trees would be installed in the public right-of-way on the two project frontages. 

A 70-foot-long passenger loading zone (white curb) and a 100-foot-long commercial loading zone (yellow curb) would be requested on Oak and Divisadero streets, respectively. Sidewalk bulbouts would be installed along Divisadero and Oak streets, extending the width of the sidewalks from 10 to 16-feet-wide. 

The relocation of 1060-62 Oak Street would be completed in accordance with plans and details in Page &Turnbull, 1060-62 Oak Street Relocation and Rehabilitation plan set, April 2019 and Bill Brown Construction, 1060/1062 Oak Street Shoring and Move Narrative, undated. In addition to being relocated, additional work proposed for the historic building at 1060-62 Oak Street includes the removal of non-historic rear and side-yard additions; the replacement of non-historic windows with new, historically appropriate windows; the replacement of the front entry doors with new, historically appropriate doors; the replacement of the security gates at the front entries; selective repair and in-kind replacement of siding and ornamental wood features; and interior alterations.

The project site is occupied by a 27-foot-tall, two-story over basement, industrial building that is approximately 13,710 gross square feet in size with 12 below-grade parking spaces. The existing automobile repair garage building was constructed in circa 1914 and is currently vacant (formerly occupied by ?Green Street Auto Body?). 

The project sponsor proposes a two-story vertical addition and a change of use to convert the existing automotive garage to a new residential development with five residential units. The project would add approximately 13,408 gross square feet to the existing building. The project includes 2,265 square feet of private open space via balconies and terraces. The project includes alterations to the front facade, including the restoration of two pilasters that were removed from the central arch to allow for a wider garage opening during a 1933 alteration. With the proposed improvements, the building would be 40 feet tall (53 feet tall with elevator penthouse) and 27,118 gross square feet in size with 10 below-grade parking spaces and five class 1 bicycle parking spaces. In addition, the project includes the expansion of the existing basement by 1,615 square feet (from 5,516 square feet to 7,131 square feet). 

Project construction would require up to approximately 15 feet of excavation below ground surface, resulting in approximately 1,400 cubic yards of soil disturbance. 

Conventional hand-excavated end-bearing piers would be used for the proposed underpinning system. Heavy equipment would not be used within 10 horizontal feet from adjacent shallow foundations and basement walls; jumping jack or hand-operated vibratory plate compactors would be used for compacting fill within this zone. 

The project requires conditional use authorization approval by the Planning Commission pursuant to Planning Code Sections 209.1 and 303 to permit a two-story vertical addition and a change of use from an automobile repair garage to a residential building containing five new residential units within the RH-2 (Residential-House, Two-Family) Zoning District and 40-X Height and Bulk District.].","PROPOSAL IS TO MAINTAIN (E) GARAGE WALLS & CONSTRUCT (5) (N) RESIGENTIAL UNITS WITHIN (E) STRUCTURE & IN A TWO-STORY VERTICAL ADDITION.

The Property consists of the historic two-story (one story with basement level) Bank of California building (the ?Bank?).  The Project Sponsor also owns the adjacent 21-story office tower located at 430 California Street (Block 0239/Lot 029)(the ?Tower?), which is connected to the Bank via two openings on the ground floor.                                                                                
The Bank is San Francisco Landmark Number 3 under Article 10 of City of San Francisco?s (the ?City?) Planning Code (the ?Code?), and it is designated as a ?Category I? significant building under Article 11 of the Code. Because the proposal includes newly instituted ground-floor office use in the C-3-O District, conditional use authorization is required.  The Project requires no new construction, demolition, or additions to the Property.  
The conversion to office space will help support the  revitalization of the underutilized historic Bank, while at the same time retaining the Bank?s historic features and character as an important City Landmark. The Project is the final component of the Project Sponsor?s larger renovation and rehabilitation of the Property, which includes complex seismic and structural upgrades and minor exterior upgrades. Specifically, the Project Sponsor has been working to create a program for the Property that supports and maintains the historic characteristics of the Bank and has already obtained building permits for seismic upgrades and such work is currently underway.  Additionally, in order to accommodate future occupancy and exiting needs from the proposed new office use, the Project Sponsor is also seeking a Certificate of Appropriateness from the Historic Preservation Commission (HPC) for the following modifications: 
1)  Widening an existing ground floor connection between the Bank and the Tower. The opening exists within the west wall of the Bank but must be widened to comply with current accessibility and egress requirements. The enlarged opening will remain below the decorative stone frieze. 

2)  Removal of the existing 1967 entry doors. Two strategies are under consideration for removal of the existing 1967 entry doors. The existing door hardware and pull forces are non-compliant with current code requirements or a future tenant's access and security needs, and therefore must be removed.

Taken together, the building permit for seismic upgrades, Certificate of Appropriateness and this Conditional Use authorization will help support the revitalization and maintenance of this underutilized historic Bank, with minimal interference to the Bank?s character defining features.",,9330,0,,0,0,,0,0,,9330,9330,,0,0,,0,-9330,,0,,0,0,,,,CASBAGH,"400 California, LLC, c/o Kennedy Wi",,9499339725,,2020,Q4,2020_Q4,4 - Downtown,3,Aaron Peskin,Financial District,Financial District/South Beach,Downtown Streetscape Plan; Downtown,C-3-O,350-S,Downtown/Van Ness/Northeast Neighborhoods PDA,,37.7933042886,-122.401458997,POINT (-122.401458997 37.7933042886),108,108,6,3,8

The project site is located on the block bounded by Pacific Avenue to the north, Jackson Street to the south, Van Ness Avenue to the west, and Polk Street to the east. The project site is currently developed with an approximately 12,409-gross-square-foot (gsf), 32-foot-tall, one-story-with-mezzanine building with former office (670 gross square feet), industrial (6,625 gross square feet automotive repair), and retail-restaurant/bar/place-of-entertainment (5,113 gross square feet) uses. 

The proposed project would demolish the existing structures and construct an approximately 49,268-gross-square-foot, seven-story 72-foot-tall (up to 80 feet tall including parapets, stairs, boiler room, and elevator penthouse) residential mixed-use building with retail and residential on the ground floor and a one-level basement with residential vehicular parking. The residential portion of the proposed project would accommodate approximately 46 one-bedroom apartments, 11 two-bedroom apartments, and six three-bedroom apartments, for a total of up to approximately 63 residential dwelling units. The retail portion of the proposed project would be comprised of up to an approximately 874-square-foot area on the ground floor. The new approximately 8,705-square-foot basement would provide space for storage and an approximately 6,099-square-foot garage for 24 vehicles. The new garage would be accessed via a new curb cut on Pacific Avenue up to 14 feet in width, replacing an existing 11-foot-4-inch-wide curb cut in approximately the same location. The proposed passenger loading would occur on Pacific Avenue at the northeast site frontage. The project would replace one Pacific Avenue on-street metered parking space with one on-street passenger loading space (approximately 20-feet long), and add new street trees. Approximately 64 class-1 bicycle parking spaces would be provided within the basement of the building, and six class-2 bicycle parking spaces (four residential and two retail) would be installed on the adjacent sidewalks. The proposed project would include excavation of approximately 5,268 cubic yards (8,436 square feet) of material, in a 1,666-square-foot area, to a maximum depth of 22 feet below grade. Up to approximately four new street trees would be planted (approximately five on Pacific Avenue and one on Van Ness Avenue).

They are lots 007-011, 016, & 017 in block 5827. The site slopes steeply downhill from north to south, and the Porter Street right of way is only developed to the top parcel. Four parcels do not have frontage on a built street. Roscoe Street is completely unimproved. The adjacent building to our north encroaches approximately 9' on to lot 007. 

Our project proposes to develop all seven parcels as new 2 unit buildings, with 6 including ADUs. This would be a total of 20 dwellings. Due to the site gradient, each unit will step down the hillside with a new public staircase. With the stepped down massing, at any point the building will only measure 3 stories tall at any segment. Main site access will be from the one developed frontage at 134 Porter Street. The Roscoe Street buildings would have a passageway to the Porter St Stair. Access/egress is also provided via Alemany Public Housing below the site.

The top building 134 Porter has a unique layout. The lower unit has a split level arrangement, with a common bike parking/garbage area at the Porter entrance. A one bedroom unit would be located above. The adjacent building has a 9'-0"" encoarchment that we propose to leave in place. Our new building will require a Variance to locate in the front of the lot. 

The remaining 6 buildings have two units per the RH-2 Zoning, and ADUs in the lowest level. They are all two bedrooms and two bathrooms. The total for the project is 39 bedrooms and 39 bathrooms. Open space will be provided for all units in the rear yards.

The block is bisected north-south by Capp Street.  The vacant site previously operated as an auto repair business. The site contains 14 off-street surface parking spaces on a paved lot and one 16-foot-tall, single-story, 1,300-square-foot building at the rear property line. The building was constructed in 1960. The project site has an existing 35-foot-wide curb cut at South Van Ness Avenue. 

The proposal is to demolish the existing parking lot and building and construct a five-story, approximately 50-foot-tall, 15,560-square-foot residential building with 15 dwelling units. The roof would contain an elevator overrun, with a maximum height of approximately 60 feet. The unit mix would be six two-bedroom units, eight one-bedroom units, and one studio unit.

The ground floor would include a trash room, and a garage. The garage would include four vehicle parking spaces and a bicycle room with 19 Class 1 bicycle parking spaces. The project would reduce the existing 35-foot-wide curb cut to 10 feet for access to the new 10-foot-wide garage door.

The proposed foundation is concrete spread footing. Construction would occur over 21 months. The project would involve excavation to a depth of 6 feet and approximately 520 cubic yards. 

A ?Notification of Project Receiving Environmental Review? was mailed on June 17, 2019 to adjacent occupants and owners of buildings within 300 feet of the project site and the Mission neighborhood group list.

The lot is L-shaped, with approximately 92 feet of frontage along North Point Street and approximately 46 feet of frontage along Larkin Street. There are three lots at the corner of Larkin Street and North Point Street that separate the two frontages. The site is moderately upsloping along Larkin Street, moving south from North Point Street to Bay Street. The project site is within a NC-1, Neighborhood Commercial Cluster District and a 40-X Height and Bulk District.

An approximately 29,400-square foot parking garage, constructed in 1925, currently occupies the project site. The garage frontage is two-stories tall on North Point Street. Along Larkin Street, the lower floor of the garage is semi-subterranean, such that the frontage is one story tall. Access to the garage is provided via a curb cut and vehicular entrance on North Point Street, with an exit via curb cut on Larkin Street. A third curb cut on North Point Street is presently disused. The garage provides 65 spaces of pre-reserved monthly paid parking. 

The project would demolish the existing garage and construct two four-story, 40-foot-tall buildings (with maximum height of 46 feet for roof extensions and appurtenances). The two proposed buildings would be connected at the parking level, which would serve as the base for both buildings. Due to the grade change of the project site, this would be the ground level for the proposed building along North Point Street and a subterranean basement level for the proposed building along Larkin Street. In combination, the two proposed buildings would provide approximately 44,839 gsf of development, including approximately 12,700 square feet (sf) for a semi-subterranean parking garage, approximately 26,000 sf to accommodate 34 dwelling units.  The residential unit mix would consist of 10 studios, 12 one-bedrooms, 8 two-bedrooms, and 4 three-bedrooms units. The garage would provide 34 vehicle parking spaces, 34 class 1 bicycle parking spaces, and garbage and recycling collection areas, with vehicle entrance via a new 10-foot-wide curb cut near the western edge of the North Point Street frontage. The project also would provide two class 2 bicycle parking spaces along North Point Street.  The building along North Point Street would contain a ground floor commercial space and a residential lobby entry for the residential units within the North Point building. A separate residential entry would also be provided for the building along Larkin Street including two units that have direct walk-up access. Each building would have an elevator and stairwell, and direct pedestrian and bicycle access to the shared garage. The project proposes a total of 2,000 sf of common open space including approximately 1,500 sf of common open space on the second level (atop the semi-subterranean garage) that would be shared between the two buildings and would be accessible from both, and an approximately 500 sf common open space deck on the fourth level of the proposed Larkin Street building. Decks, patios, and stoops within various levels of the two buildings would provide a total of about 2,700 sf of private open spaces. Consistent with the Better Roofs Ordinance, solar panels would be provided on the North Point Street building roof.

Construction would require approximately 650 cubic yards of soil excavation. The depth of excavation is proposed at a maximum of 3 to 8 feet below ground surface within a 5,700 sf area. Construction activities would occur over 16 months commencing in March 2020 and are anticipated to be completed in June 2021.",,1282,1282,,,0,,,0,,,0,,,0,,1282,1282,,0,,,0,,,,CASBAGH,TEF Design,Andrew Wolfram,415-901-4912,,2020,Q4,2020_Q4,3 - Northeast,2,Catherine Stefani,Russian Hill,Russian Hill,FishermanΓÇÖs Wharf Public Realm Plan; Northeast Waterfront,NC-1,40-X,Downtown/Van Ness/Northeast Neighborhoods PDA,,37.8051470334,-122.422351049,POINT (-122.422351049 37.8051470334),98,98,6,6,32

The Project is within the boundaries of the Mission sub-area of the Eastern Neighborhoods Plan Area and is located in the Mission Miracle Mile 19th to 20th Streets Historic District. The Sites are currently improved as follows:
? 2316/2318 Mission Street: 2-story, 4,720 sf, vacant commercial building that was formerly occupied by Mission Jewelry & Loan. In the past it contained a 2-bedroom rental dwelling unit on the second floor which was vacated in the late 1970s.
? 2320 Mission Street: 1-story, 2,250 sf, vacant commercial building that was formerly occupied by Mission Jewelry & Loan
? 2326-2330 Mission Street: 2-story, 4,500 sf, building w/ a vacant commercial space that was formerly occupied by Mission Thrift, and a 3-bedroom rental dwelling unit on the second floor that is currently occupied.
The Project proposes to merge the 3 parcels into a single one measuring 7,194 sf, remove the two existing dwelling units, and construct a new 7-level, 85-feet tall, mixed-use residential building that retains/restores the existing 3 facades including their respective recessed entries. The Project?s 34 dwelling units would be distributed from the 1st through the 7th levels. The 1st level would contain 2 rear- yard facing dwelling units, 2 independent commercial spaces for retail sales and service uses, the residential entry, and miscellaneous mechanical spaces. The Project would also have a partial basement, in the location of the existing basement, to be used for bicycle parking, storage and miscellaneous mechanical spaces. In total, the Project area would be 39,110 sf.
Utilizing the California State Density Bonus Law, the Project proposes thirty-four (34) residential units distributed as follows: fourteen (14) two-bedrooms, ten (10) one-bedrooms & ten (10) studios. Twenty- five percent (25%) or six (6) of the Project?s 25 base dwelling units will be on-site Below Market Rate (BMR) units with three (3) at 50% (Lowest) AMI, one (1) at 55% (Low) AMI, one (1) at 80% (Moderate) AMI and one (1) at 110% (Middle) AMI.
The Project would have no parking and would provide a total of thirty-four (34) Class 1 and four (4) Class 2 bicycle spaces along the Mission Street frontage.
The Project would provide a 15?-0? deep rear yard which would extend from the 1st level and above. The new residential levels would be set back 5?-0? from the front property line. Residential open space would be provided either as private or common. The 1st level dwelling units would have private rear yards. The remaining dwelling units would have access to a landscaped common open space located at the 7th level.",,1293,-8177,,0,0,,0,0,,0,0,,0,0,,1293,-8177,,0,,0,0,,,,MGIACOMU,Workshop1,,4155230304,,2020,Q4,2020_Q4,8 - Mission,9,Hillary Ronen,Mission,Mission,Mission (EN); Mission District Streetscape Plan; Mission Public Life Plan,NCT-MISSION,55-X,Eastern Neighborhoods PDA,Mission Alcohol Restrict; Mission Street Formula Retail Restaurant Subdistrict; Fringe Financial Services RUD,37.7598042316,-122.419467685,POINT (-122.419467685 37.7598042316),53,53,3,2,20

Existing retail use would also be reconfigured on floors 4-6 to provide for multiple tenants. The project would include a change of use of 49,999 sf of retail use into office use on floors 6-7. A new roof top addition of approximately 10,800 sf is proposed for restaurant use. It would increase the building's total height from about 104 feet to 120 feet. The gross square footage for the proposed reconfigured building would be approximately 246,800 sf.

Proposed streetscape improvements include three new street lights, one existing relocated streetlight, and about 10 new street trees. All improvements would be coordinated with the SFMTA's Central Subway project plans. There is no existing or proposed off-street vehicle parking, but the project would request the SFMTA to install 28 class 2 on-street bicycle parking spaces in dual bike racks on Stockton and O'Farrell Streets, and would also install 30 class 1 bicycle spaces in the basement level. The existing uses are served by a loading dock containing three loading bays accessed from the narrow Security Pacific Place. This loading dock would be reconfigured for two loading bays and one service bay.

The project would require excavation of approximately 4,300 cubic yards of soil for structural upgrades to the building that would include perimeter tie beams, shear wall, and a sewage ejector and grease interceptor. The depth of excavation would extend to 12 feet below the existing basement. No particularly noisy equipment or impact equipment/devices would be required for construction of the proposed improvements. Construction activities would include demolition, site preparation, grading, interior and exterior upgrades to be completed in overlapping phases commencing in March 2019 and anticipated to be completed in May 2021.",,206840,-10141,,,0,,,0,,49999,-3890,,,0,,156841,-6251,,0,,,0,,,,RSALGADO,"Reuben, Junius & Rose, LLP",Tuija Catalano,4155679000,,2020,Q4,2020_Q4,4 - Downtown,3,Aaron Peskin,Financial District,Financial District/South Beach,Downtown Streetscape Plan; Downtown,C-3-R,80-130-F,Downtown/Van Ness/Northeast Neighborhoods PDA,,37.7869796745,-122.405953356,POINT (-122.405953356 37.7869796745),19,19,6,3,8

The project site is on block 3635 bounded by 22nd Street to the north, Valencia Street to the east, 23rd Street to the south, and San Jose Avenue to the west, in the Mission neighborhood. The project has a 52.4-foot frontage on Valencia Street and a 52.77-foot frontage on San Jose Avenue. The existing project site is a paved parking lot with 12 spots that was associated with the now closed Lucca Ravioli Company. 

The proposed project would demolish the existing parking lot and construct a new 55-foot tall five-story mixed use building approximately 22,400 square feet in total area. The proposed project would include 18 residential units that include 9 one bedroom, 7 two bedroom, and 2 studio units that would be accessed via San Jose Avenue. The project also would include 4,334 square foot commercial space that consists of ground floor retail (1,526 square foot) and a retail mezzanine (756 square foot) fronting Valencia Street as well as partial basement for commercial storage (2,325 square feet). Given the lot depth, double street frontages and adjacent context, proposal includes full lot coverage (rear yard variance) and proposes a common roof deck for the residential units.

The project would remove two existing curb cuts located on Valencia Street and San Jose Avenue. The project does not propose off-street parking. The project would not have any passenger or freight loading zones. The project would add one on-street parking space on Valencia Street and one parking space on San Jose Avenue. The project would add 18 class 1 bicycle parking spaces in a ground-floor bike storage room accessed from San Jose Avenue. Two class 2 bicycling parking spaces would be added to the Valencia Street frontage and two street trees would be added to the San Jose Avenue frontage. 

The building will have a mat slab foundation with no soil improvements. The proposed structure would have a 2,325 square foot partial basement on the west site of the building. The east half of the parcel (1,755 square feet) would require approximately 390 cubic yards excavation and the western basement (2,325 square feet) basement would have approximately 1,206 cubic yards of excavation. The project excavation would range between 4 to 14 feet in depth below San Jose Avenue for the basement, foundation, and elevator shaft. The project would require shoring consisting of 18-inch diameter drilled, cast-in-place, reinforced concrete piers with horizontal wood lagging around the boundary of the lot that would extend at a minimum of 10 feet below the bottom of the planned excavation, which is approximately 24 feet below San Jose Avenue or 20 feet below Valencia Street.",ERECT A 5 STORIES/18 DWELLING UNITS MULTI-FAMILY/RETAIL BLDG.

The proposed project would involve both interior and exterior tenant improvements to the existing four-story-over-garage building and remodeling of the basement, with no expansion of the existing building envelope. The proposed project would involve a change of use of approximately 32,600 square feet of space in the building which is currently used as a public parking garage into office use at the basement and ground floors, with the addition of an approximately 5,000 square foot mezzanine level with office uses and approximately 1,000 square feet of retail use on the ground floor. The proposed project would also raise the ground floor slab to provide adequate ceiling heights for the basement area and provide stairs and a limited-use elevator to link the new ground floor with the basement and mezzanine. Project construction would be expected to require excavation to a depth of 3 feet over the approximately 17,900 square foot site, resulting in excavation of 1,985 cubic yards of soil for ground floor slab improvements. The proposed project would also infill the three existing parking entrances onto the street with new windows and doors, eliminate the three existing curb cuts and 185 parking spaces, and add 7 Class I bicycle parking spaces.

It fronts 15th Street (95.125') and is currently improved with a 10,470 gross sqft, two-story commercial building covering 100% of the lot, which was constructed in 1916. The building is vacant and formerlyhoused an automotive service company. There are no current sidewalk improvements or street trees.The Project proposes to demolish the existing building and replace it with a 50-unit all-residential, all-electric 46,739 gross sqft building. The building would consist of a 6-story, 65' tall portion with 5 stories of Type IIA cold-formed steel framing over one story of Type IA reinforced concrete podium with 46 dwelling units, and two, 2-story, 25' tall, Type IIA portions with 2 dwelling units each. The proposed building would reduce lot coverage to 8,456 sqft or 84%. The foundation is intended to be a reinforced concrete slab at grade over torque down piles. No on-site car parking is proposed.The new building proposes the following supply of new ownership condominiums: 21 two-bedrooms, 21 one-bedrooms and 8 studios. The average unit size is 935 sqft. The proposed primary building portion includes 8 dwelling units per level on levels 2-6 with a common area roof deck of 2,756 sqft. The ground level consists of 10 dwelling units between the front and rear portions, as well as the required accessory spaces inc. lobby, bike parking, mail/package facilities, mechanical/utility rooms and exit corridors. Two stairs and one elevator service the front portion. The rear portion is accessed through a common central courtyard via a door accessible from the building lobby and by exterior stairs for the second-level units.Residential open space is provided as both private and common area. All residents would have access to a landscaped deck at the roof level. Private open space is provided through either private balconies or yards.There is no on-site car parking in order to maximize housing and encourage alternative modes of transit. There are 50 Class I bike parking spaces on-site and accessible from the ground floor lobby, as well as 4 Class II spaces on the sidewalk. The existing 3 curb cuts and street parking along the project frontage are proposed to be re-purposed forpassenger loading and commercial and motorcycle parking. Four street trees and sidewalk improvements are proposed.The Project provides 11 on-site BMR dwelling units (27% of the Base Project of 39) with at least 15% at 80% AMI (low income) and utilizes the California State Density Bonus Law. This entitles the Project to a 27.5% unit bonus or 11 units for a total of 50. The Project plans to utilize the available SDBL incentives/waivers/concessions for an increase in allowable building height and to reduce rear-yard setbacks in order to accommodate density bonus units.The exterior design was informed by bay window and ground floor residential guidelines, while the color palette is informed by the Latinx and LGBTQ history of the neighborhood.",,2696,-7774,,,,,,,,,,10470,0,-10470,0,2696,2696,,,,,,,,,KDURANDE,Kotas / Pantaleoni,,4154954051,,2020,Q4,2020_Q4,8 - Mission,8,Rafael Mandelman,Mission,Mission,Mission (EN); Mission District Streetscape Plan,NCT-VALENCIA,55-X,Eastern Neighborhoods PDA,Mission Alcohol Restrict; Fringe Financial Services RUD,37.7662616133,-122.422810388,POINT (-122.422810388 37.7662616133),37,37,3,5,20

This project requires a General Plan Referral because it requires a Major Encroachment Permit.
 
Eagle Plaza will transform a portion of 12th Street between Harrison and Bernice Streets in Western SoMa, within the Eastern Neighborhoods Plan Area, into a new public pedestrian-oriented plaza with both greening and LGBTQ/Leather pride commemorative elements. Significant greening is a primary aim of this project, given the dearth of public green space in Western SoMa. In addition to maintaining or replacing all existing trees on site and adding 5 net new trees, Eagle Plaza will create over 3,000 square feet of native, drought-tolerant vegetation where there was none before.
Equally importantly, Eagle Plaza is designed to be a physical commemoration and celebration of the rich LGBTQ and leather cultural history of the surrounding Folsom Gulch neighborhood. Such a space has been called for by the community and the City and, while Eagle Plaza is and always will be a public place welcoming to all ages and demographics, several elements will highlight this important LGBTQ and leather heritage. A central flagpole flying the leather pride flag will build the plaza?s identity, similar to the rainbow pride flag?s role in the Castro. As a playful nod to the area?s history and the Folsom Street Fair, the paving will be dark with inlaid metal ?studs.? In addition, the neighborhood stage area located outside the SF Eagle would be a place for community events featuring local artists, musicians, speakers, and more.

Eagle Plaza will fill important unmet needs in Western SoMa, both for new public green space and for commemoration of Folsom Gulch?s rich LGBTQ heritage. These needs have been identified in multiple City planning documents:

1 Western SoMa Community Plan, Sections 4 and 7.
2 Western SoMa Community Plan, p7.2
3 Western SoMa Citizens? Planning Task Force?s 2008 Strategic Analysis Memo on Open Space. Page 13

DETAILED:  Every community aspires to have a physical place that distills and embodies the values of its past and aspirations for its future. 233 Geary is just such a place. Situated in the heart of San Francisco?s world-renowned and cosmopolitan Union Square district, 233 Geary will convert the existing building into a healthy and sustainable mixed-use 21st century building, while delivering a restored and refined Late Moderne jewel to downtown San Francisco. 233 Geary will uniquely achieve the highest standards of health, sustainability, contemporary usage and historic preservation, while infusing them with the best qualities of life in San Francisco.

233 Geary integrates the wisdom and wishes of the community to improve upon the vitality of the existing Union Square district, while respecting historical stewardship, thus ensuring its success for future generations. The accelerated need to create spaces that encourage health and nurture vibrancy revealed by the current COVID-19 pandemic are met by the forward thinking innovation incorporated into the design of 233 Geary. It finds a balance between our modern needs for finding new ways to live, work and shop and our eternal need to embrace our history through preservation. 

Sand Hill Property Company acquired  the 233 Geary building from Macy's in January 2019. Macy's had a series of unsuccessful redevelopment efforts over the past 25 years, since retail occupancy began to decline in the 1990s. Department stores have been downsizing in San Francisco's central shopping district as shoppers have shifted online. 233 Geary will transform the existing failed large department store building into a 21st century world-class, mixed-use development with 11 floors, two penthouse levels and two basement levels, organized as follows: residential units on floors 9-11 and a residential penthouse level (with approx. 52,000 gsf), office on floors 4-8 serving emerging or established San Francisco companies (with approx. 93,000 gsf) and multi-tenant retail on the first three floors and one basement level, which will include the areas of the existing tenants Louis Vuitton and Loro Piana (approx. 60,000 gsf).

To accommodate the new residential, office, and retail uses, 233 Geary also seeks to introduce exterior modifications to the facade by restoring and refining the Late Moderne elegance of the mid-20th century luxury department store, commonly known as the I. Magnin Building: increased window height and additional corner and top floor windows at floors 4-11 for residential and office viability, and increased storefront transparency at floors 1-2 for street activation and Union Square vibrancy.

The existing building contains approx. 50,000 gsf of legal, grandfathered office area and approx. 155,000 gsf of retail area.",,153644,-51691,,0,0,,0,0,,93190,42992,,0,0,,60454,-94683,,0,,0,0,0,0,0,JVIMR,"233 Geary Street Property Owner, LL",,4155679000,,2020,Q4,2020_Q4,4 - Downtown,3,Aaron Peskin,Downtown/Civic Center,Financial District/South Beach,Downtown Streetscape Plan; Downtown,C-3-R,80-130-F,Downtown/Van Ness/Northeast Neighborhoods PDA,,37.7868201113,-122.407176454,POINT (-122.407176454 37.7868201113),19,19,6,3,8

The site is currently occupied by a two-story-over-basement, 50-foot tall building containing an automobile dealership and showroom. The proposed project would renovate the interior of the building and convert the existing automobile dealership and showroom to a health club containing exercise equipment, group fitness rooms and locker room spaces, a lounge, restaurant, and indoor pool on the second floor. In addition, the project proposes to convert a portion of the roof above the proposed swimming pool into a retractable roof. There would be no physical expansion of the existing building envelope. The health club would occupy approximately 39,940 square feet in the basement, ground, and second floors.

Gov. Code Sec. 65915, et. seq.). The Site is located on the west side of Mission Street between 19th and 20th Street and has approximately 80 feet of frontage along Mission Street. The Project is within the boundaries of the Mission sub-area of the Eastern Neighborhoods Plan Area and is located in the Mission Miracle Mile 19th to 20th Streets Historic District. The Sites are currently improved as follows:
? 2316/2318 Mission Street: 2-story, 4,720 sf, vacant commercial building that was formerly occupied by Mission Jewelry & Loan. In the past it contained a 2-bedroom rental dwelling unit on the second floor which was vacated in the late 1970s.
? 2320 Mission Street: 1-story, 2,250 sf, vacant commercial building that was formerly occupied by Mission Jewelry & Loan
? 2326-2330 Mission Street: 2-story, 4,500 sf, building w/ a vacant commercial space that was formerly occupied by Mission Thrift, and a 3-bedroom rental dwelling unit on the second floor that is currently occupied.
The Project proposes to merge the 3 parcels into a single one measuring 7,194 sf, remove the two existing dwelling units, and construct a new 7-level, 85-feet tall, mixed-use residential building that retains/restores the existing 3 facades including their respective recessed entries. The Project?s 34 dwelling units would be distributed from the 1st through the 7th levels. The 1st level would contain 2 rear- yard facing dwelling units, 2 independent commercial spaces for retail sales and service uses, the residential entry, and miscellaneous mechanical spaces. The Project would also have a partial basement, in the location of the existing basement, to be used for bicycle parking, storage and miscellaneous mechanical spaces. In total, the Project area would be 39,110 sf.
Utilizing the California State Density Bonus Law, the Project proposes thirty-four (34) residential units distributed as follows: fourteen (14) two-bedrooms, ten (10) one-bedrooms & ten (10) studios. Twenty- five percent (25%) or six (6) of the Project?s 25 base dwelling units will be on-site Below Market Rate (BMR) units with three (3) at 50% (Lowest) AMI, one (1) at 55% (Low) AMI, one (1) at 80% (Moderate) AMI and one (1) at 110% (Middle) AMI.
The Project would have no parking and would provide a total of thirty-four (34) Class 1 and four (4) Class 2 bicycle spaces along the Mission Street frontage.
The Project would provide a 15?-0? deep rear yard which would extend from the 1st level and above. The new residential levels would be set back 5?-0? from the front property line. Residential open space would be provided either as private or common. The 1st level dwelling units would have private rear yards.

The project site is located on a roughly triangular-shaped block bounded by Hudson Avenue to the northeast, Newhall Street to the southeast, and Innes Avenue to the southwest.

The proposed project would demolish the existing vacant lot, remove an existing general advertising sign, and construct an approximately 36,130-square-foot, 60-foot-tall, five-story mixed-use residential building. The building would include 32 dwelling units and approximately 3,780 square feet of ground-floor and mezzanine-level single retail space fronting Third Street. The residential portion of the building would consist of 15 one-bedroom units, 15 two-bedroom units, and two three-bedroom units. The five-story mixed-use building would provide approximately 8,020 square feet of common space. Open space would be provided through a common roof garden and a private deck for one residence. The approximately 1,740-square-foot ground-floor garage would provide space for 11 cars utilizing three, three-tier parking stackers (eight standard vehicle parking spaces, one Americans with Disabilities [ADA]-accessible space, and two car share spaces). The garage would be accessed via a new 10-foot-wide curb cut on Hudson Avenue. Thirty-two Class 1 bicycle parking spaces would be provided in a ground floor bicycle room, accessible via Newhall Street or through the residential lobby fronting Third Street. Ten Class 2 bicycle parking spaces would be provided adjacent to the project site on the surrounding sidewalks.

The proposed project would include excavation of approximately 300 cubic yards of material to a maximum depth of 8 feet below grade. The proposed foundation for the  building would be  drilled piers extending at least 10 feet below-grade and into bedrock. The proposed project would retain all of the existing street trees on the project site and would provide an additional seven street trees on Newhall Street, five street trees on Hudson Avenue, and two street trees on Third Street. A bulbout and parklet are proposed on the southeastern portion of the block, to increase the sidewalk width along Newhall Street.",,0,0,0,,,0,,,0,,,0,,,0,,,,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,2020,Q4,2020_Q4,10 - South Bayshore,10,Shamann Walton,Bayview,Bayview Hunters Point,Bayview Hunters Point,NCT-3,65-X,Bayview/Southeast Neighborhoods PDA,Third Street; 3rd St Alcohol Restrict; Fringe Financial Services RUD,37.7398944602,-122.388648903,POINT (-122.388648903 37.7398944602),86,86,2,9,1
